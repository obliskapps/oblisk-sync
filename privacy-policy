Privacy Policy for Oblisk Sync
Introduction
This privacy policy outlines how Oblisk Sync ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects any information that you provide while using our Chrome extension. By installing and using Oblisk Sync, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

Information Collection and Use
Oblisk Sync is designed to save and restore your browsing sessions across devices. To facilitate this functionality, we collect and use the following types of data:

Session Data: We collect URLs and titles of the tabs you save within a session. This data is encrypted with your private key and transmitted to Nostr relays to enable session restoration across devices. The encryption ensures that only you can access your session data.
Data Storage and Security

Local Storage: Your private keys are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted. This local storage is used to encrypt and decrypt your session data.
Nostr Relays: Encrypted session data is stored on decentralized Nostr relays, not on our servers. This ensures that your data remains under your control and is accessible only by you.
Data Sharing
We do not share any data we collect from you with third parties. Your encrypted session data is stored on Nostr relays, and no third party has access to your unencrypted data.

Data Security
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. While no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, we take all necessary precautions to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. The use of encryption for session data enhances the security of your information.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
